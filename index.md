**PhD Candidate in Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University**  
**Robotics & Multi-Agent Systems · Safe RL · UAV & AMR Control**

I work at the intersection of **nonlinear control**, **multi-agent deep reinforcement learning**, and **real-world robotic systems**. My recent projects focus on **safe TSY null-space RL for bearing-rigid quadrotor formations** and **multi-robot route planning for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)** in ROS2-based systems.

- **Now:** Safe RL and bearing-rigid formation control for multi-UAV systems (NTU UAV group).
- **Core tools:** ROS2, PX4, Gazebo, C++17, Python, data structures & algorithms.
- **Keywords:** UAV formation control, safe RL, control barrier functions, multi-agent path planning, warehouse robotics.

## Selected Projects

### Safe Null-Space RL for Bearing-Rigid UAV Formations
- Combines a rigidity-based formation controller with deep RL in the TSY null space.  
- Enables safe translation, scaling, and rotation of multi-UAV formations while preserving bearing rigidity.  
- Implemented in C++/Python + ROS2, evaluated in cluttered and dynamic environments.

### Multi-Robot Route Planner for AMRs (ROS2)
- Designed a **GraphPlanner + AgentMonitor** pipeline for large-scale AMR fleets in warehouse-like environments.  
- Implemented collision detection, deadlock resolution, and route validation for dozens of robots.  
- Includes a benchmarking framework to compare planning algorithms at scale.  
- Designed a modular code architecture for multi-agent operation in real deployments.

### [TODO] Additional Highlighted Project
*(For example: your UAV MPC implementation from the IEEE Access paper, or a UAV formation demo with PX4/Gazebo.)*  
- **Title:** `TODO: Add project title here`  
- **One-line summary:** `TODO: Add 1–2 sentence description and key technologies.`
