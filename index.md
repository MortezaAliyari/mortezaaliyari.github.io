# Morteza Aliyari

I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University
and a robotics engineer working on multi agent deep reinforcement learning, MADDPG, UAV formation control, multi-robot
path planning, and ROS2-based autonomous systems.

## Research Interests

- Multi-UAV formation control and bearing rigidity
- Safe reinforcement learning and control barrier functions
- Multi-agent route planning and deadlock resolution
- ROS2, PX4, Gazebo, and real-world robotic systems
- Strong coding capability on C/C++ and Python with understanding of data structure and algorithms

## Selected Projects

### Safe Null-Space RL for Bearing-Rigid UAV Formations
- Combines a rigidity-based controller with RL in the TSY null space.
- Ensures collision-free translation, scaling, and rotation of the formation.
- Implemented in C++/Python + ROS2; evaluated in cluttered environments.

### Multi-Robot Route Planner for AMRs (ROS2)
- Designed a GraphPlanner and AgentMonitor pipeline for multi-robot navigation.
- Implemented collision detection, deadlock resolution, and route validation.
- Includes a benchmarking package to compare planning algorithms at scale.
- Designed a code architecture for mutli agent operating in real work.
